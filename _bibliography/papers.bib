  abstract={Recent deep learning models demand larger datasets, driving the need for dataset distillation to create compact, cost-efficient datasets while maintaining performance. Due to the powerful image generation capability of diffusion, it has been introduced to this field for generating distilled images. In this paper, we systematically investigate issues present in current diffusion-based dataset distillation methods, including inaccurate distribution matching, distribution deviation with random noise, and separate sampling. Building on this, we propose D3HR, a novel diffusion-based framework to generate distilled datasets with high representativeness. Specifically, we adopt DDIM inversion to map the latents of the full dataset from a low-normality latent domain to a high-normality Gaussian domain, preserving information and ensuring structural consistency to generate representative latents for the distilled dataset. Furthermore, we propose an efficient sampling scheme to better align the representative latents with the high-normality Gaussian distribution. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that D3HR can achieve higher accuracy across different model architectures compared with state-of-the-art baselines in dataset distillation.},

  abstract  = {Cross-modal Steganography is the practice of concealing secret signals in publicly available cover signals (distinct from the modality of the secret signals) unobtrusively. While previous approaches primarily concentrated on concealing a relatively small amount of information, we propose THInImg, which manages to hide lengthy audio data (and subsequently decode talking head video) inside an identity image by leveraging the properties of human face, which can be effectively utilized for covert communication, transmission and copyright protection. THInImg consists of two parts: the encoder and decoder. Inside the encoder-decoder pipeline, we introduce a novel architecture that substantially increase the capacity of hiding audio in images. Moreover, our framework can be extended to iteratively hide multiple audio clips into an identity image, offering multiple levels of control over permissions. We conduct extensive experiments to prove the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating that THInImg can present up to 80 seconds of high quality talking-head video (including audio) in an identity image with 160x160 resolution.},
