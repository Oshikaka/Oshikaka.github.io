I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [College of Engineering, Northeastern University](https://coe.northeastern.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Octavia Camps](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/camps-octavia/). I earned my undergraduate degree (BSc) with Distinction from the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), where I completed a combined major in Computer Science and Statistics with Distinction.

How can we design models that emulate human learning processes? This question has always lingered in my mind, drives my research interests across **Generative AI**, **Multimodal Machine Learning**, and **Computer Vision**. 

I am currently seeking **internship** opportunities to deepen my experience and contribute to impactful work in these areas. Please feel free to reach out to discuss potential opportunities or research collaborations.
